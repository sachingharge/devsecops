DevSecOps is an extension of the DevOps model, in which developers, security, and operations teams work together closely through all stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. 

DevOps introduced the use of automation and streamlined processes to increase development velocity and improve software quality. DevSecOps adds security to this equationâ€”building security into the process and eliminating silos between development, operations, and security teams. It ensures that a DevOps environment incorporates security best practices and security testing, from planning and development, through testing, staging, and deployment.

Tools are a critical part of DevSecOps because, in a fast-paced DevOps environment, security must be automated and closely integrated with the CI/CD pipeline. 

DevSecOps tools have two main goals. The first is to minimize risk in development pipelines, without slowing down velocity, by detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities through continuous security testing. The second is to support security teams, allowing them to oversee security of development projects without needing to manually review and approve every release.
